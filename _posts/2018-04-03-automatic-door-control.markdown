We are very pleased to announce that Automatic Door Control was a winner at the 2018 Severino Center E-Ship.2 Business Pitch Competition. The project secured $1000 in funding to continue development of a SmartPhone/hardware application that will allow the remote opening of doors at RPI for those students with mobility issues! Congratulations to Mallory Gaspard, Andrew DeMarco, Erin Jordan, Jacob Lane, John Hulton, and Niteesh Thangaraj!
