“Although RCOS is overseen and advised by faculty, students are certainly the driving force behind its success,” says Goldschmidt, who works with Wes Turner, RCOS Director, to run the program. “Student mentors are each assigned a few projects, with student lead coordinators orchestrating much of everything else. Our role as faculty boils down to meeting with lead coordinators to help obtain resources they may need, handling the administrative duties, and coordinating with outside companies and other faculty doing work applicable to the world of open source software.”
